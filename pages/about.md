Hi, I'm Raymond, a Computer Engineer & Scientist, and Product Manager.   
<br>     

I like problem solving, and reading.  I write at [blog.reader](https://muyun.github.io/).    
<br> 

You can find some of my projects [here](https://github.com/muyun). If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss, send me a mail at wenlzhao@gmail.com,
I’d like to hear from you.   
<br> <br> 

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-improvement, and experiencing something new. 
<br> <br>
